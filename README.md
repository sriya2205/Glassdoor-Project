***Project Overview

This project analyzes job listings data from Glassdoor to uncover insights about salaries, company characteristics, job roles, and skills demand.
Using Python for data analysis and machine learning, the project also builds predictive models to estimate job salaries based on multiple features.


*** Skills & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data Cleaning & Processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning Models

NLP (optional) – Extracting insights from job descriptions

Jupyter Notebook – Development Environment


*** Problem Statement

Job seekers often lack clarity about salary expectations and factors influencing compensation.
This project addresses the problem by:

Cleaning and analyzing Glassdoor job dataset.

Identifying trends in salaries across industries, job roles, and locations.

Building predictive models to estimate job salaries.


*** Business Use Cases

For Job Seekers – Understand salary expectations and skill demand.

For Companies – Benchmark salaries against competitors.

For Recruiters – Identify high-demand roles and optimize job postings.

For Researchers – Explore patterns in job market data.


*** Project Workflow

Step 1 – Dataset Understanding

Explore Glassdoor job dataset (glassdoor_jobs.csv).

Inspect job title, company rating, location, skills, and salary.

Step 2 – Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.

Standardize salary columns.

Extract useful features (e.g., company age, job seniority, skills).

Step 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Salary distribution by job role, industry, and location.

Company rating vs salary analysis.

Word clouds / keyword extraction from job descriptions.

Step 4 – Feature Engineering

Encode categorical variables.

Extract seniority levels (e.g., Junior, Senior).

Create derived features from text data.

Step 5 – Model Building

Train ML models such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Evaluate with R², RMSE, MAE.

***Dataset

File: glassdoor_jobs.csv

Features: Job Title, Salary Estimate, Job Description, Rating, Company Info, Location, Size, Founded, Industry, Sector, etc.
